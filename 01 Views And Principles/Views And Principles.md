# 50.2. Create a Cause-and-Effect diagram.
# 50.2. Map out Cause-and-Effect connections.
- Create a visual representation of how different elements impact one another.
- Use arrows and labels to clarify relationships.
# 50.3. Use visual elements to enhance understanding.
- Incorporate colors, shapes, and icons to make the diagram more engaging.
- Ensure the visual is easy to read and interpret.
